ICML2019 Submission 237
==

This repository contains the source code for ICML2019 submission 237 'Diversified Progressive Layerwise Adversarial Training for Improving'. We give the codes for VGG-16 on CIFAR-10.


Dependencies
--
This library uses Pytorch to accelerate graph computations performed by many machine learning models. Therefore, installing TensorFlow is a pre-requisite.<br>
Installing Pytorch will take care of all other dependencies like numpy and scipy.
